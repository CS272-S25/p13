# CS472 Group Project

Hello, CS472! This is where you can document your group project.


Our goal is to build an assignment tracking website designed to help students stay organized and manage all their assignments for each class. This site would allow users to add assignments and classes and view the assignments based on class, due date, etc. The first page would be a dashboard that gives an overview of upcoming assignments. The second would be a Classes page where the user can add and view the courses they are in. The third would be an Add Assignments page where you can add an assignment to a certain class. The fourth would be a Calendar so that the user can see all their assignments in one place. The fifth would be an assignment page where the user can see their assignments and sort them (maybe by due date or priority). The sixth would be a settings page where the user can customize their experience. The last page would be a simple About page where we can share links to our GitHub pages, etc.
